In a 1.9 billion population, there are aboout 15.70% unemployment rate in Africa as compared to the other continent, in  which females occupies a major part of the unemployment rate with about 11.5% unemployment rate. Countries like Lesotho, Djibouti, South Africa and so on appears to be the countries with the highest unemployment rate. One noticeable is spike in unemployement rate in the year 2020. This could be as a result of the sit at home initiated by the covid-19 virus which led to many people loosing their jobs.  

### Factors Contributing to Increased Unemployement Rate

The visual analysis above shows that their might not be a significant positive correlation between high government expenditure on education and reduced unemployment rate, as the countries with the highest unemployment rate still saw a higher expenses on government expenses on education. Also, it only makes sense that spending much on education without setting platforms to foster good employment opportunities, the government can just end up churning out more unemployed graduates. To further confirm this, a global analysis was carry out and it was found that Africa with the highest expenses on education are on the top chart for high unemployment rate. 

#### Does National Strategy for Youth Employment have any Effect on the Rate of Unemployment

Developing strategy appears to be leading by gap on the unemployment rate. Developing strategy only pose the false hope danger which might lead to more individuals that has lost hope in the government to provide adequate jobs. Setting up strategies or platform for youth is the only way to curb unemployement.
